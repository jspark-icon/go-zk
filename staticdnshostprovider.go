// StaticHostProvider is the default HostProvider, and replaces the now deprecated DNSHostProvider.
// It will iterate through the ZK hosts on every call to Next, and return a random address selected
// from the resolved addresses of the ZK host (if the host is already an IP, it will return that
// directly). It is important to manually resolve and shuffle the addresses because the DNS record
// that backs a host may rarely (or never) change, so repeated calls to connect to this host may
// always connect to the same IP. This mode is the default mode, and matches the Java client's
// implementation. Note that if the host cannot be resolved, Next will return it directly, instead of
// an error. This will cause Dial to fail and the loop will move on to a new host. It is implemented
// as a pound-for-pound copy of the standard Java client's equivalent:
